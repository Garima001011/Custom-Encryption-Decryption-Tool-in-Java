public enum EncryptionMode {
    AES,
    VIGENERE
}
// This enum defines two encryption modes: AES and VIGENERE.
// AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for secure data transmission.
// Vigenere is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.
